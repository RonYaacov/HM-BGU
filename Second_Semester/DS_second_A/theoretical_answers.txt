3.1 :
    in modern-day 64 bit computers w = 64
    as difined "In this task we limit the values to the long data-type of Java"
    so (a*x) is at most (2^63 -1) and at least -2^63 therfor -> (x*a) mod 2^64 = (x*a)
    the >>> operator is unsigned right shift operator and its equal to dividing by 2^(the value after >>>)
    so:  ((a Â· x) mod 2^64 / 2^(64-k)) = (a*x) >>> (64-k) 
    
    
3.2:
    transform any object recived to Byte-Array then transform each byte to a charcter 
    then use the Carter-Wegman hashing for strings as shown in section 3.1.1.3 and apply 
    any Carter-Wegman hashing function on the result
